            I love learning new games, especially ones with a bit of luck involved! I'm able to combine this with interests in math by making short Desmos projects.

                (LaTeX rendering and interpreting) - JS x React<br>
                <p>
                    I love math, and love LaTeX, and the online calculator I used didn't support all the LaTeX commands I wanted. 
                    Built an interpreter on top of an existing JS LaTeX library to get a fully functional calculator! 
                    Used MATH 101 (Integral Calculus with Applications) content to build Simpson approximation to calculate integrals. 
                    Used AP Calc AB content with definition of derivative to calculate derivatives at a point.

                (Machine learning) - Rust <br>
                <p>
                    Short thing I started during my first uni finals season to learn about ML without any libraries to help. 
                    Was a nice introduction to Rust!  
                    Tested my MATH 152 (Linear Systems I) knowledge by building a classification model just using class concepts.

                (Rendering/drawing framework) - C<br>
                <p>
                    Thought modern game engines/renderers had too many pixels and colours. 
                    Built an SDL abstraction that makes it fast and easy to produce cool, retro style games.

                <p>
                    Was my first stab at a game engine, made an entity component system based engine to ensure usage was robust.

                    Smashing binaries together so two images become one image! 
                    Learned a bit about cryptography through the surrounding research.
